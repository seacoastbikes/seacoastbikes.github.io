      <title>Bicycle Friendly State Report Card - League of American Bicyclists</title>
      <link>/happenings/bicycle-friendly-state-report-card-league-of-american-bicyclists/</link>

      <description>Every year the League of American Bicyclists issues each state a &amp;ldquo;Bicycle Friendly State&amp;rdquo; report card based on over 100 data points with input from state agencies and advocates. The 2019 report shows that out of 50 states, New Hampshire has slid down to a 36th place ranking and Maine to a 20th place ranking.
No surprise that both states earned a &amp;ldquo;D&amp;rdquo; in infrastructure and funding.

      <title>NEW BIKE/PED PATH ACROSS LITTLE BAY IS OPEN!</title>
      <link>/happenings/new-bike-ped-path-across-little-bay-is-open/</link>

      <guid>/happenings/new-bike-ped-path-across-little-bay-is-open/</guid>
      <description>The new path provides a safe route for bicycles and pedestrians across Little Bay, between Dover and Newington/Portsmouth.
This temporary Bike/Pedestrian pathway was constructed in response to many years of advocacy by SABR members to maintain bike/ped access during the reconstruction of the General Sullivan Bridge. NHDOT originally proposed a shuttle service, which SABR vehemently opposed. The emergency closure of the General Sullivan Bridge in September of 2018 necessitated NHDOT to develop a solution sooner than anticipated.</description>

      <description>About Us
SABR is an volunteer run organization dedicated to making biking better in the Seacoast. Mission statement. Vision statement.
The work (actually a labor of love!) gets done by dedicated people who share their talents and passion for biking.
We’ve been around since 1992 and helped create significant improvements for local bicycling – be it new infrastructure (e.g. bike paths, bike bridges) and incubating new programs (e.g. VeloKids, Bike to Work Day).</description>
